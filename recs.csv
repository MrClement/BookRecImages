A Short History of Nearly Everything is a book about the history of our universe and the sciences that attempt to explain it.

It manages to be incredibly informative while reading with the engagement and ease of a comedy novel. It acknowledges that the universe is incredibly complex and may never be fully understood or explained, and embraces that fact as something that makes life worth experiencing and exploring.

As hard as it was to follow a book filled with subtle 80s trivia music, arcade games, and movies (no I was not born in the 80s), the mere idea of a virtual contest in a virtual world had me fascinated from the beginning. The book follows Wade Watts, a teenage boy from the ‘stacks’ (slums) of Oklahoma, in his everlasting quest to find James Halliday’s video game easter egg. Unlike most video games which are played on simple technology, such as the modern TV, in 2045, games are played on the OASIS, a full body immersive simulation, much like virtual reality. On his journey, Wade faces challenges one could only dream, and despise, of facing. He must choose between guaranteed money from a corrupt organization and keeping his morality.

He had no knowledge of how he had gotten there, or any memory from his life. The only thing that he was certain of was his name. At this point I was already extremely excited to see what the rest of the book would entail. The awesome part about The Maze Runner was that this same level of suspense lasts throughout the entire book. When I started reading it, I couldn’t stop.

4/24/18 14:32,Kelly,Brown,2019,Not found,The Danish Girl,Ebershoff,David,Historical Fiction,"One of the most intriguing novels that I read this year was The Danish Girl by David Ebershoff. Inspired by the true story of Lili Elbe, the first transgender woman to undergo sex reassignment surgery, this novel follows Lili, Einar, and his wife, Greta, through the journey of Einar’s transformation into Lili. This story brings up an interesting question: what makes a woman a woman? Although ultimately Lili determines that undergoing sex reassignment surgery will make her feel like a true woman, Lili’s journey through identity is a fascinating and enlightening thing to read as a cisgendered woman, and I do strongly believe that a person can identify with whatever gender they feel is appropriate for themselves, regardless as to what is between their legs. Additionally, I do not believe that there are only two genders, but through literary devices, such as olfactory imagery and some recurring motifs, Ebershoff explores the stereotypes of the gender binary, thus causing the reader to question our perceptions of gender. While this piece does not shed light on being transgender in today’s society, it reminds us that transgender is not a new concept, for many people throughout history have been assigned a gender at birth that they do not identify with. Overall, The Danish Girl is an intriguing read to explore not only what it might have been like to be LGBTQ+ in the early 20th century, but also what challenges one must face when once coming to terms with a person’s own identity.",,,,,

Set in the 1930’s during the Great Depression, racial tension is high in the small, southern town of Maycomb, Alabama. Narrated by Scout Finch, a little girl who lives with her older brother Jem, her father Atticus, and a black housekeeper named Calpurnia, Scout retells a story of three years.

However, after their father’s decision to represent Tom Robinson, an innocent black man accused of raping a white woman, the children are quickly exposed to racial tension. Under the moral teachings of their father, Atticus, Scout and Jem challenge the racial prejudice in their community.

Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is one of the best fiction/action/adventure (with a hint of romance and mystery) books I have ever read. The title is unique as it draws any gamer in as most recognize the famous phrase. It is about a futuristic Earth where everywhere is overpopulated and there is almost nothing to do. Then, this video game designer named James Halliday created a virtual utopia called the Oasis. In the Oasis, nothing is limited and you can be anything or one and have virtually everything. There is a currency system in the game (coin) and you can earn coin by gambling, leveling up, killing other avatars, and many other ways. A unique thing about the Oasis is it has a one life per avatar meaning, if you die, you lose all your stuff and you have to start all over. The main story of Ready Player One is in the Oasis, Halliday created three keys that ultimately led to a final easter egg, which led to ownership, and in turn, full control, of the Oasis and around 3 trillion dollars. The main character, Parzival, real name Wade Watts, is a gunter, which is a term used for people who hunt for the egg. When he finds the first key, an evil corporation called IOI comes after him. This is a big moment as nobody has made any luck finding anything for three years.  Parzival, along with his love interest, Art3mis, and his other allies, Aech, Daito, and Shoto have to stop IOI and save the Oasis. Cline does a great job describing the details of the story, from dropping little easter eggs for current gamers, and explaining what is happening for people who have never held a controler, he is a amazing character creator who makes lovable, relatable characters. He could also be a puzzle creator as the challenges to get to the keys are extremely challenging and intriguing. I highly recommend for people who are into action and pop culture and even if you don’t know anything about it, he does a great job describing the significance so anybody can read it without getting lost.

While a lot of dystopian future books have the same idea or story behind it, this trilogy went off its own idea and had many unique and interesting attributes. The characters have complicated and fantastic backstories, and the plot moves along smoothly across the book and fits in with the entire idea of the book as well. The book has a little bit of everything, suiting to match everyone’s interests; heartbreak, comedy, thrills, sci-fi, and just a little bit of romance (not enough to make it sappy, of course). This book is truly one of the greatest books, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to read it.

I felt nervous when I read that Tom and Huck saw their nemesis Injun Joe murder someone, and I was very excited when Huck was finally adopted by a very nice woman.

This book challenges the reader to move from present to past as most of the book occurs in individual flashbacks from each of the soldiers, detailing frightening encounters while at war. The war stories are different in this novel, as there is no true hero, which enables the writer to truly go through each soldier’s dealing with his emotions and how they stayed sane while at war.

     Written in 1949 during the anxiety and uncertainty of the Cold War, Orwell’s seminal piece 1984 was written to envision a dystopian future that warned of powerful centralized government control over the free will choice of the individual. Protagonists Winston and Julia live in the megastate of Oceania, in which all individual expression is repressed under the all seeing eye of Big Brother. Even nearly three quarters of a century after its’ original publishing, 1984’s cautionary tale of the threatening power of the collective over individual choice remains relevant to this day. As contemporary debate rages on regarding the power of centralized social media platforms to control increasing aspects of everyday society, 1984’s central thesis serves as a powerful reminder of protecting the free will of individual choice.

But when their east born daughter dies, they decide to have another child to replace her. In an accidental mix up, their new daughter, Rose, is born facing north. In an attempt to save Rose from her destiny, her parents lie, saying she was born to the obedient and flexible east. One day a talking polar bear shows up at their house to claim Rose’s birthright, taking her with him. He takes her to his home: an enchanted hidden ice castle where silent servants wait on Rose hand and foot. She weaves on a loom in a secret room all day and waits for a stranger to climb into her bed each night.

The retelling follows the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew on the Endurance on a failed expedition to the South Pole and their incredible journey back to civilization. The writing is descriptive and clear in the most elegant way possible; the smallest details do not go unnoticed. Alfred Lansing interviewed the crew of the Endurance long after their voyage and recalled their memories, and even read some of their personal journals from the expedition. That makes for a very accurate and interesting retelling of the tale, with thoughts from different perspectives collected and told by the omniscient narrator. Those details make the book even more enthralling and interesting to read, and put you in the shoes of the men on board and make you understand what the men went through.

Eventually, the characters realize they are being watched, and they start to rebel against the author. The tools of magical realism, a popular writing strategy in Latin American fiction, shape a story that is real enough to place yourself in the story, but fictional enough to seem like a fantasy story. The People of Paper is simply too much to describe in a short book recommendation, and even too much to describe in an essay. The story will take your mind on loops: if you try too hard to understand it, you will be forced to put it down.

Most of the book is told from the perspective of a boy named Finn who lives in the small town of Bone Gap with his brother Sean.  One day, Finn finds a mysterious woman named Rosa in their barn, and she lives with him and his brother until she is suddenly kidnapped.  Finn sees the kidnapping, but because he cannot remember the kidnapper’s face, the town and his brother refuse to believe him.  The storyline follows his adventures to find Rosa as well as looks into his relationship with the strange looking outcast, Priscilla (Petey).  The second narrative comes from Rosa, describing her captor and her attempts to escape.  The characters are so developed they pop off the page with quirks and downfalls. The setting can be both poetic and eerie, a demonstration of the duality of quaint beauty.  Family and fitting in are two themes in this book, amplified through the judgmental town.  These two themes may be popular, however the author writes in a way where it seems as if one is seeing them for the first time.  The writing style is perfect for the tone of the book adding to its intrigue with poetic paragraphs.  The conflict will leave the reader on edge using the classic cat and mouse chase with a twist.  Bone Gap is a masterpiece told through magical realism, however it keenly demonstrates our everyday struggles.",,,,,

While normally partaking in very different activities, somehow they both find themselves in the senior play together. After spending long hours and days together, they realize they are not so different from each other as they think they are and they both start to increasingly open their heart.

In a time where one’s identity can be a matter of life and death, the unnamed storyteller attempts to navigate his way through the Jewish ghetto, all the while searching for who he is. This novel not only explores life in Nazi Germany, but the dangers and experiences of living in the Warsaw Ghetto. This novel is great for anyone that enjoys an action-packed coming-of-age story, as well as someone who wants to learn the horrors of the Jewish ghettos. By using elements of real-life as well as fiction, the author manages to keep the reader in suspense for the entire novel. Milkweed, which I originally read in 6th grade, is to this day one of my favorite books of all time. Anyone that is looking to pick up a book and not put it down should read Milkweed, a tale of heartbreak, hope, and survival during the Holocaust.",,,,,

The book centers around three siblings who struggle with the world handed down to them and the strange magic that their family is known for. The descriptions are vivid and authentic, and it’s difficult not to relate to each character as they find their way through the twists and turns of the novel. Though the concept of the story is quite simple - a family able to grant miracles - the way the characters handle it and grow together is anything but. The book encourages introspection among the characters, and through them encourages the reader as well to look inside and ask many of the same questions the characters have to ask themselves. The book explores the idea that there are no minor characters - each character is given their own time to figure themselves out, and all of them feel profoundly honest, yet flawed. The reader ends the book with a grasp on each character as a human being, and finds comfort as each character finds their way out of the complex situation they unintentionally placed themselves in.

The writing style works to extract the exhausting, boring, or even tedious work experienced in a math class, leaving only the raw underlying theory. Each and every chapter can be read in a stand-alone format without a need for an in depth understanding of mathematics or even any content from the previous chapters.

Also, every year is the same. She visits her friend, Windy, hangs out with her Grandma, goes to the beach and has fun. But this one summer, everything seems weird and different. So, she has to figure what has been going on and she comes understand the sudden changes that have been affecting her life. What I like most about the novel is that it explores the hardships adolescents face and how they slowly lose their innocence and understand the real world. While it does contain mature language and adult references, I think it is important at this age to understand why the author has included certain themes. Most importantly, I could empathize with the storyline. I feel that this book would suit a variety of people with different tastes and it is a good book to read to relax and enjoy.

J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit is a great read for those who love journey and adventure. In this wonderfully engaging piece, The Hobbit explores the conflict of inaction and complacency versus action and altruism. This creates tension between characters which keeps the reader engaged and anxious to find out what happens next. Additionally, the theme of character is intertwined in the book by exploring the challenge of doing what is right instead of what is easy, which pairs perfectly with the conflict of the book. Through the perspective of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, the reader embarks on a quest with him and his company of dwarves to reclaim their homeland from Smaug the dragon. Bilbo and his company have many chances to give up and turn back, but they persist. While there are some slow parts spread intermittently throughout the book, they are made up for by the extremely fast-paced action scenes and rich vocabulary. If you are looking for an action, fantasy, or adventure book, The Hobbit is for you.

One of my favorite books I have ever read over the summer was J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, the first of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book takes place years after The Hobbit concludes. It follows the story of the young nephew of the previous book’s protagonist named Frodo. He is tasked with returning a cursed ring that had been stolen by his uncle years ago. He is joined in his quest by several of his hobbit companions, and later he is aided by humans: elves, dwarves, and even a wizard. The story follows Frodo and his comrades as they attempt to destroy the cursed ring, and combat a growing evil in their land. This book is extremely well written and well paced. It will keep even the most reluctant of readers engaged and is an amazing book to take on over the summer. ",,,,,

The book starts out at the hobbit's house. Twelve dwarves  come knocking on his door looking for his help on what will be and unbelievable journey. The dwarfs will fight side by side with Bilbo Baggins. They fight dragons and do other crazy stunts. I liked the book mostly because it was just fun to read. This brilliant book will make anyone's imagination race. Whether its traveling through the forest by foot or racing around the planes with horses, there is never a dull moment. tThis book is one of my favorites!",,,,,
4/27/18 9:12,Amelia ,Saffold,2021,,The Fellowship of the Ring,Tolkien,J.R.R.,"Action / Adventure, Fantasy","Written by the widely esteemed author J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring begins the story of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins and his friends (including other hobbits, elves, men, and dwarves) on their quest to destroy Middle Earth’s greatest evil. The Ring of Power has been passed on to young Frodo, who has no idea about its great capability and corrupting spirit, and terrible creatures of darkness from the evil land of Mordor have begun to hunt him down. With the help of Gandalf the Grey (a wizard), Sam Gamgee, and two other hobbit friends, he travels to the elf haven of Rivendell where their quest truly begins. Tolkien beautifully continues the story of The Hobbit with glimmering detail, wonderful language, and a twisting plot that will have you feeling as if you were standing right there alongside Frodo and his companions. Although it may be at times hard to read, the characters make up for it in this iconic piece of fantasy. ",,,,,

One night Tom and Huck go to a graveyard and witness a murder committed by Injun Joe. While looking for treasure one day they see Injun Joe with a box of gold. This story includes action, drama, and adventure. By being from Tom’s point of view the reader gets a great look into his life that helps give insight and context into his actions in Huck Finn. This book is an incredible exciting read filled with lots of action, this book is never dull and never gets boring and I would strongly recommend it.

4/27/18 13:50,Annie,Hansen,Faculty/Staff,,Faceless Killers,Mankell,Henning,Mystery,"This is the first book in a series of murder mysteries by Swedish author Henning Mankell. The story begins when Detective Wallander (vall ON der if you wish to speak Swedish) is summoned to investigate a disruption in a farmer’s field. When he arrives, a teenage girl is setting herself on fire before his eyes. While her behavior is not criminal, it is so desperate that Wallander cannot help but try to discover her identity and her story. His efforts prove fortuitous when he discovers a ring of human trafficking.
Several of the books have been beautifully rendered into movies starring Kenneth Branagh (you might remember him as Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter). Just as in the stories themselves, the countryside of Sweden assumes the role not only of alternatingly lush and stark backdrop, but also it becomes a silent and ever-present character, a witness to the crimes themselves.

4/19/18 9:31,Tara,Lyons,2019,,The Bible ,Various ,Authors,Religious ,"	The Bible is one of the most popular books in the world. It was written in the 6th century, B.C. which sometimes makes it hard to understand. However, the general lessons that are presented in the bible are very valuable. A common misconception is that if you aren’t Christian, you will not understand the Bible. But, you don't have to be religious to dive into a different culture and period of time. I recommend this book because I respect someone who can sit down and read a type of literature that is outside of their box and comfort zone. So the next time you see a Bible in your hotel room, read a passage and realize the amazing morals and lessons that are before you.

Set in an alternate reality where the Crimean War has extended into the mid-1980s, British citizens have maintained their love of literature despite living in a near police state.  In a world where one can enter novels and interact with literary characters, our heroine Thursday Next is a Special Ops agent assigned to the Literature Division charged with prevention and correction of literary crimes.  Master criminal Archeron Hades steals original manuscripts of novels and threatens to permanently erase beloved characters from the pages unless his ransom demands are met.  When Hades abducts Jane Eyre from the original Bronte manuscript, Thursday must take action.  Further description of this witty tome may only confuse and dissuade potential readers, as it almost did for me.  Rest assured that complete familiarity with Jane Eyre is not a necessity as I found a Wikipedia synopsis of the novel to be sufficient to enjoy one of this novel’s main conceits.  If you like the novels of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, Fforde’s first Thursday Next novel may be just your cup of tea!   ",,,,,

Never fitting in this young, mischievous boy finds ways to fit into groups that he does not racially belong to. Being comedian the book is naturally hilarious and will keep you entertained for hours, from being thrown out of a car to going on a date with someone who cannot speak the same language as him. Along with being a good laugh it also gives a deeper understanding of the power and intricate dynamics of race and class. Not just giving knowledge of what they are, but also how to bypass them. This book is great because it really gives a perspective that not many people have on how the world works and gives the ability to see how something as simple as how straight your hair is or how strong your accent is could have taken away your rights, freedom, and even life during apartheid.

The results were devastating: Dresden went from one of the most beautiful cities in Europe to ash and rubble. This destruction of beauty is a common theme throughout the book, as the protagonist Billy Pilgrim struggles with the notion and attempts to rationalize the war and his life through any means necessary.

We All Looked Up is a classical high school story with a huge twist. The book emphasizes the cliqueness of highschool by writing chapters from different perspectives of the multiple characters that fall in a variety of social groups. The typical problems of the characters involve struggles with parents, friends, school, and other teenage pressures. The thing that makes this novel so unique is for the majority of the story an asteroid is coming towards earth, and it is a complete toss up whether or not it will hit. There are a multitude of reactions to this, involving riots, suicides, and complete normality. Because there is both the chance that the giant space rock could hit earth or not, it causes people to either live like there is no tomorrow or continue on living their average high school life. The classic social groups start to dissolve, and the real values of life begin to emerge as all the students bond over a common fear of destruction and the same hope of a future life. This coming of age story helps put high school problems in perspective and causes the reader to think about how he/she would react in a similar situation. We All Looked Up is a well written story that I would recommend to every high schooler looking for a good coming of age book that is easily relatable.

4/30/18 6:58,Evan,Stubbs,2022,,March Toward the Thunder,Bruchac,Joseph,"Action / Adventure, Historical Fiction, Realistic Fiction, Young Adult","Bruchac, Joseph								March Toward the Thunder

As an avid reader, I can definitively say that this is one of the more fascinating historical fiction novels I have read. Set in 1864, it follows the life of an Abenaki Indian named Ned Begay who is fighting in the ongoing Civil War. He initially joined because of an ongoing family financial crisis. He stayed because of the genuine human connections he forged. One of the reasons I really liked this novel was because it directly addressed the harmful cultural and societal prejudices that can not only divide individuals, but entire nations. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in war history, the history of minority people, or just a good adventure.

4/27/18 13:13,Amanda,Schlatter,2019,,The Glass Castle,Walls,Jeannette,"Literary Fiction, Memoir ","The Glass Castle, by Jeannette Walls, is a novel that not only sparks the interest of young readers who are struggling through their identity within or outside of their own families, but it also intrigues adult readers, who read this novel as an opportunity to reflect on their own lives--their struggles as well as their accomplishments. The Glass Castle recounts the unorthodox, impoverished childhood of four children growing up in a household that defies all the stereotypes of family life. In the start of this novel, Walls contrasts the idealistic approach of many other novels that make the reader optimistic about the world. Rather, this novel takes on a realistic approach that centers the readers to the truth of not only the life of the Walls family, but also to the truth of every reader’s life. However, as the novel progresses and there is character and plot development, readers are able to see that regardless of the challenges that families or individuals face, that should not discourage one from setting and achieving goals, hopes, and dreams.

This particular collection of Calvin and Hobbes comics centers on one where Calvin goes to Mars to escape Earth's pollution. These books are aimed at all ages of people and toward anyone who wants a good laugh.

For example, Hans is unable to find work in the community due to members boycotting him not joining the party. The book continues to develop when Hans offers Max Vandenburg, a Jew in hiding, refuge in their home. Leisel eventually befriends Max, and continues to question the political environment around her.

Told from the perspective of Death, the book follows a ten-year-old girl name Liesel Meminger as she is placed in a foster home and raised in Nazi Germany during WW2. This book provides insight into how dark the lives were for the people suffering during WW2, and how selective it was to have a good and safe life during this time. Although I was required to read this book for class the first time that I read it, I have read it several times since because it is so fascinating and interesting. If you are looking to completely get lost in a book, this one is very hard to put down.",,,,,
4/30/18 19:46,Finn,Cooper,2022,,Steve Jobs ,Isaacson,Walter,Non-Fiction,This is a great book for anyone who likes a good story that influenced their life daily.  For me this explained a lot about the tech industry and especially Apple. It's not just a boring dry book. Steve Jobs is an eccentric and sometimes crazy guy and you never know what to expect. I would recommend this book to anyone who's ever owned an Apple products.,,,,,

This book is a very gripping science fiction/action novel. When I read The 5th Wave, I couldn’t put it down! Not only is it a fascinating story about an alien takeover of Earth, but the way the Rick Yancey tells the story from the perspective of multiple characters helps the reader better understand the plot of the story. The different perspectives also help with character development, which is very prominent in the story.

Fortunately, the Milk, by Neil Gaiman is a book written to remind you to appreciate what you have. It is a odd story about a dad who needs to get milk for his kids. He turns this boring walk to the corner store into a wild adventure around the world where the only reason he survived was because of his milk. The writing was fast and hard to follow but only made you want to learn more about it. I liked it because it had a unique moral and an interesting plot. I would recommend it because it was also fairly short making it a quick read for any occasion.
